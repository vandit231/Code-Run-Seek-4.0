          IEEE Industrial Applications Society, a group of undergraduates at
          VIT, is dedicated to build a bridge between enthusiasm and excellence
          by providing a platform for brainstorming solutions to the industrial
          world, through the largest research conferences, expert talks,
          seminars, and boot camps. We link research to practice, thereby
          connecting students to industry experts. To promote technology among
          the students even during the pandemic, we organised a variety of
          productive technical sessions, Hackathons, Techathons, and Ideathons,
          as well as some other events.
